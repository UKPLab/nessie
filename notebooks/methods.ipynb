For instance, token and span labeling typically are given as ragged/nested arrays, that is arrays of a varying second dimension (because the number of tokens is different per sentence). These are flattened when passed to most general methods and unflattened to their original shape. For span labeling, we also work on span-level and not on (BIO) tag level, therefore, spans need to be extracted and outputs from models need to be aggregated from token to spans. We also need to align predictions of models with the given span labels, as they can differ due to different boundary predictions. `nessie` provides helper functions for these operations."
